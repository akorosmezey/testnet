Thank you for your interest in Aeternity.
There are issues on the github that need taking care of: https://github.com/aeternity/testnet/issues
Erlang is a rewarding language http://learnyousomeerlang.com/content
You can help us plenty without learning Erlang, we have lots of javascript that needs to be written.
If you have any questions about Aeternity or blockchain technology, feel free to email me: zack@aeternity.com

If you type up a proposal for an improvement you can make, and send the proposal to me, and we end up using your work or idea, then Aeternity might give you a bitcoin or ether prize.

Simply installing the software and syncing up with the testnet can be a big help, if you find a bug.







For people interested in writing smart contracts:

Here is the repository that has the VM and some compilers.

Aeternity smart contracts are different. The computation is all off-chain.
I think the first step would be to talk to me about what you want to make.
I can quickly tell you what is possible, and give you the tools you need.

On Aeternity the smart contract itself is usually the easy part. The hard part is the handshake for updating the state of the smart contract. Sending messages back and forth, and correctly handling them. It is important that your partner is unable to trick you into updating your copy of the channel state to an invalid channel state.
